# My Writeups
I love to participate in Capture The Flag events especially during my free time! During my first few months of playing CTFs, I had so much help from reading other people's writeups and this has inspired me to create writeups of my own! Hopefully this would help you in your CTF experiences, I would be using this as a reference for myself in case I had forgotten about certain tricks too!

Check out my [CTFtime](http://ctftime.org/user/106126), I mainly use CTFtime to scout for any upcoming interesting CTFs!

Take a look at my mini blog, hosted on [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/@b0o5t3d)! This is where I mainly publish my writeups and codes!

I am also an avid subscriber on [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/p/b0o5t3d)! This is where I practice my skills!

I have recently started [HackTheBox](https://app.hackthebox.eu/users/521845)! It has been quite challenging, though fun!
